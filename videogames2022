Question: Which genre was published in the overall year?

SELECT count(genre), genre FROM video_games
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY count(genre) desc

Answer: The adventure genre was the most published game genre all year.

If we wanted to find out what genre was popular for a particular month, then we can do this:

#change the month in the WHERE month = '_____' for a particular month.

SELECT count(genre), genre FROM video_games
WHERE month = 'JANUARY' 
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY count(genre) desc

If we wanted to be even more specific and choose a day, then we could include one more clause to our query. 

#this example will use the dates January 1 to January 15 (inclusive). 

SELECT count(genre), genre FROM video_games
WHERE month = 'JANUARY'
AND day BETWEEN 1 AND 15
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY count(genre) desc
