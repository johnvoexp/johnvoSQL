#We will specify the year first using a WHERE statement. Next, we will use an AND statement and use between because it will be inclusive of 43 and 47.

Question: Discover the spending costs made by the first 10 ranked companies.

Select rank, company, revenue, profit, (revenue-profit) AS costs

3	"U.S. Steel"	"$3,250.40"	"$195.40"	"$3,055.00"
4	"General Electric""$2,959.10"	"$212.60"	"$2,746.50"
5	"Esmark"	"$2,510.80"	"$19.10"	"$2,491.70"
6	"Chrysler"	"$2,071.60"	"$18.50"	"$2,053.10"
7	"Armour"	"$2,056.10"	"$1.60"		"$2,054.50"
8	"Gulf Oil"	"$1,705.30"	"$182.80"	"$1,522.50"

10	"DuPont"	"$1,687.70"	"$344.40"	"$1,343.30"

#note, these are all in millions. 
As we can see, the rank 1 company, General Motors, incurred costs of 9017.5 million. 

Question: How many fortune 500 companies made a profit of over 100 million in the year 1955?

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fortune_companies
WHERE year = 1955 AND profit >= '100.00'

Answer: 12. 12 companies made a profit of over 100 million in the year 1955. 
If we wanted to analyze further, we could say that 12/500 or 2.4% of companies in the year 1955 made over 100 million.
An interesting thing to note is that we can also see that the first 12 ranked companies didn't all make over 100 million.

SELECT rank, company, profit FROM fortune_companies
WHERE year = 1955 AND profit >= '100.00'

1	"General Motors"	"$806.00"
2	"Exxon Mobil"		"$584.80"
3	"U.S. Steel"		"$195.40"
4	"General Electric"	"$212.60"
8	"Gulf Oil"		"$182.80"
9	"Mobil"			"$183.80"
10	"DuPont"		"$344.40"
11	"Amoco"			"$132.80"
12	"Bethlehem Steel"	"$117.20"
14	"Texaco"		"$226.10"
16	"Shell Oil"		"$121.10"
18	"ChevronTexaco"		"$211.90"

We can see that the ranks vary and doesn't go straight from 1st to 12th.
This is because the ranks are determined by overall revenue rather than overall profits.
