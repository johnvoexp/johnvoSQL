Question: If we wanted to know the particular name and revenue (in millions) of companies ranked 43 to 47 in 1955, how would we do it? What are the companies?

SELECT company, revenue FROM fortune_companies
WHERE year = 1955 AND
rank BETWEEN 43 AND 47

Answer:
"Eastman Kodak"	"633.5"
"Goodrich"	"630.7"
"Continental Group"	"616.2"
"Bendix"	"607.7"
"Atlantic Richfield"	"596.2"

#We will specify the year first using a WHERE statement. Next, we will use an AND statement and use between because it will be inclusive of 43 and 47.
