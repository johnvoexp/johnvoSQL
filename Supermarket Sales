#We will start with simple questions and get progressively more in-depth. 

Question: How many of either gender (M/F) was represented in buying something from any one of the three branches?

#This will be simple, just do a count for one of the genders, then we can subtract from 1000 to get the other.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
WHERE gender = 'Male'

Result: 499 Males. Thus 501 Females. 

Question: How many of the 499 males were shoppers at Branch A, B, and C?

#Here, we are separating the branches into different groups. Then, we want to COUNT(*) all the results. 

SELECT branch, COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
WHERE gender = 'Male'
GROUP BY branch

Result:
"A"	179
"B"	170
"C"	150

#If we wanted to do the opposite for females, then...

SELECT branch, COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
WHERE gender = 'Female'
GROUP BY branch

"A"	161
"B"	162
"C"	178

#And if we REALLY wanted to double check to confirm, then we could remove the WHERE clause...

SELECT branch, COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
GROUP BY branch

"A"	340
"B"	332
"C"	328

#The numbers add up, so everything looks good.

#OK. Now let's get a bit more complicated...

Question: Out of all the female shoppers in each branch that bought a health and beauty product, how many at least a total of 80 dollars?

#The goal is to create specific clauses. We can start with gender to elimate all the male customers. Next, set a >= clause set to 80. 
#Finally, we specify which product line with an ILIKE (in case of any spelling errors).

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
WHERE gender = 'Female' AND total >= 80
AND product_line ILIKE 'Health%'

Result: 50 female customers spent at least 80 dollars on a health and beauty product within the past 3 months.

#We will go a little further and see how these particular 50 customers paid for their product(s). We'll add a simple clause in the select and a group by statement.

SELECT payment, COUNT(*) FROM supermarket_sales
WHERE gender = 'Female' AND total >= 80
AND product_line ILIKE 'Health%'
GROUP BY payment

"Credit card"	15
"Ewallet"	    18
"Cash"	      17
